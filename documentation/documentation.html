<center><h2>haXMS Documentation || 1.0.0b</h2></center>
<br />
Welcome to the haXMS Documentation release for haXMS 1.0.0b (UserSys).
<br />
This documentation is covering the 1.0.0b release of the haXMS, which
contains the <b>Login</b> module, <b>Register</b> module, and <b>News</b> module.
<br /><br />
These modules can be used in the future with the haXMS system (which will include future module
releases), or, they can be used with your own site. This documentation will be covering configurables,
includes, and classes.
<br /><br />
<b>Future releases</b> will be even more modular than now... more will be handled with database+JSON, less
with hardcoding... more modules in future releases, official templates, and a fully eqipped ACP.
<hr />
<center><h2>Configurables</h2></center>
Configurables can be found throughout the following files (* = required):<br />

Firstly notice that we have commented the main idea on each line. You can remove these
comments if you wish, but these are here for organization and to help you quickly identify
definitions to edit if you ever need to in the future.
<br />
<br />

<i>SITE</i><br />
This is the title of your site. Not necessarily the domain, but the name that will be
placed between &#60;title&#62; tags, &#60;meta&#62; descriptors, and possible future 
places where the title of your site can best be placed at without you having to edit
hundreds of files each time. If you include the 'hx_config.php' file anywhere, you can at
anytime echo SITE to display your site title. 
<br />
<br />

<i>PATH</i><br />
This is the path where haXMS subdirs will be kept. This is important to define because
PATH is used within the code of the class files constantly to define where things are located.
The default is "sys", because, the subdirs (modules, lib) are located in this directory. If you
rename the "sys" directory, you need to edit this line to what you have renamed "sys" to.
<br />
<br />

<i>HOME</i><br />
This is your site homepage. This is generally used for redirecting users to a safe location after
a process. 
<br />
<br />

<i>AUTH</i><br />
This is the location of your login file. We have provided you with a "login.php" file, but this file
is not required (unlike the entire sys directory and it's sub-directories). The LOGIN definition is
generally used if a user is trying to view a page they do not have access to (for instance, a
page that is only available to users who are logged in).
<br />
<br />

<b>Note:</b><br />
The login and registration system handles user information through a database (mySQL). In order to use
either the registration or login class, you need to have a database setup.
<br />
<br />

<i>HOST</i><br />
This is the database host. The default is localhost, or, 127.0.0.1 - :3306 is the mySQL port.
<br />
<br />

<i>DB</i><br />
This is the name of your database. There is no "true" default because you need to create your database
through some sort of administration - we can not do this for you. (See phpMyAdmin)
<br />
<br />

<i>USER</i><br />
When connecting to your DB, there must be authorized access (or else any person could connect to your
database). This is the username that is setup with your database.
<br />
<br />

<i>PASS</i><br />
When connecting to your DB, there must be authorized access (or else any person could connect to your
database). This is the password that is setup with your database.
<br />
<br />

<i>LISTEN</i><br />
If enabled, your index page will listen for $_GET parameter "act", which will in turn load the specified
module for you. If no specified module is found, the default module will be loaded.
<br />
<br />

<i>IDX</i><br />
This is your default module to load. This only matters if LISTEN is set to true. The default module will
be loaded on "index.php", or if the specified module to be handled does not exist.
<br />
<br />

<i>PKEY</i><br />
This is your site's global hardcoded password key which may be used by various modules for an additional
layer of security. Blended together with a salt + password + hashed makes a bruteforce attack against
a hash much more difficult to carry out. (PKEY should never be changed, and should be 64 characters minimum)
<br />
<br />

<i>REC_PUB</i><br />
This is a public key used with the third party module "reCAPTCHA". We have provided you with our own
public key for your use, but if you wish to use your own public key, you can change this value. 
<br />
<br />

<!--<i>GUSR</i><br />
This boolean describes if a function will be used on each occurance the 'hx_config.php' file is included.
If this value is set to 1 (on/true), this will get the username of the current user and will assign it to
a variable called '$user'. You could then do anything with the $user variable, such as echo it or other
by simply including 'hx_config.php' in any given page. This is turned off by default because this could 
become resource intensive if you had a lot of users browsing at one time, or if a user decided they wanted
to refresh a page constantly to keep sending SQL queries to slow down server speeds. This will be more
secure in the future, but for now we recommend it is turned off unless you plan on using it with care.-->
<br />
<br />
<br />

<b><u>register.class.php</u></b>
<br />
<pre class="brush: php">
$min_usr = 3;   #Minimum length of username
$max_usr = 24;  #Maximum length of username
$min_pwd = 6;   #Minimum length of password
$max_pwd = 16;  #Maximum length of password
$pass_type = 0; #0->MD5, 1->SHA1, 2->SHA256
$register = 'register.php'; #Filename of page2register
$param = 'r'; #Paramater for $_GET for redirect. e.g. ?r=
$home = PATH . '/modules/register/templates/index.php'; #Path to index template
$vali = PATH . '/modules/register/templates/validate.php'; #Path to validate template
$subject = SITE . " Registration Confirmation"; #Email subject for validation.
</pre>
<br />

Firstly notice that we have commented the main idea on each line. You can remove these
comments if you wish, but these are here for organization and to help you quickly identify
definitions to edit if you ever need to in the future.
<br />
<br />

<i>$min_usr</i><br />
It may be inconvenient to have users registering with 1 or 2 letter usernames. You can set
'$min_usr' to the minimum amount of characters required to register with.
<br />
<br />

<i>$max_usr</i><br />
It may be inconvenient to have users registering with 2 sentence long usernames. You can set
'$max_usr' to the maximum amount of characters a user can have their username be.
<br />
<br />

<i>$min_pwd</i><br />
It is important to protect your users from bruteforcing attacks. Having a decent password is
always good. You can set '$min_pwd' to the minimum amount of characters required for a password.
<br />
<br />

<i>$max_pwd</i><br />
It is important to protect your users from bruteforcing attacks. Having a decent password is
always good. Having one that is too long may become a problem in some cases. You can set '$max_pwd' 
to the maximum amount of characters a user can have their password be.
<br />
<br />

<i>$pass_type</i><br />
We have given you the option to choose your hash type. Storing plaintext passwords in a database
can be dangerous if your database is ever compromised. You can further protect your members by
crypting their password with an algorithm. Three algorithm types are available: 1 for md5(), 2 for 
sha1(), and 3 for sha256(). 1 is used on default.
<br />
<br />

<i>$register</i><br />
This is the location of your register file. We have provided you with a "register.php" file, but this file
is not required (unlike the entire sys directory and it's sub-directories). The '$register' variable is used
in redirecting a successfully registered user to the same page, but with the $_GET parameter to define the
inclusion of the validation page. More flexibility will be available in the future. If you are renaming the
provided register file, be sure to edit this variable with the new name. If you are using your own register
file completely, see lines (118-123) in 'register.class.php'.
<br />
<br />

<i>$param</i><br />
This change of this variable is minimal to the finished product, but we wanted to provide as much customization
as possible. This is the parameter used with your register file after the user has registered, to include the
validation page. Default is 'r', so you will see: 'register.php?<b>r</b>=true' upon registration.
<br />
<br />

<i>$home</i><br />
This is the location of your registration page's template. Change this to wherever your template is located.
We have provided a default example, in an organized structure.
<br />
<br />

<i>$vali</i><br />
This is the location of your validation page's template. Change this to wherever your template is located.
We have provided a default example, in an organized structure.
<br />
<br />

<i>$subject</i><br />
This is the subject of the emails that are sent to the user for verification. Change this to best suit your
greeting. 
<br />
<br />
<br />

<b><u>login.class.php</u></b>
<br />
<pre class="brush: php">
$haxms = 1; #Are you using the haXMS registration system? 0->No, 1->Yes
$home = PATH . '/modules/login/templates/index.php'; #Path to index template
$cookie_prefix = 'hxm_'; #Unique prefix of our session.
$time = 120; #How long until our cookies expire? (Minutes)
</pre>
<br />

Firstly notice that we have commented the main idea on each line. You can remove these
comments if you wish, but these are here for organization and to help you quickly identify
definitions to edit if you ever need to in the future.
<br />
<br />

<i>$haxms</i><br />
This login system can be setup to work with your own project, or with the haXMS system. The haXMS system itself
can be extremely flexible and can work with your own project as well, so we have given you the option to define
if you are using the haXMS system. If you are, we will need to automatically detect which crypt() function the
registration system is using so we can match it up with anything posted to log the user in. If you are not going
to use the haXMS system (the registration module, in particular), then we will simply md5() the posted password on
default. If you wish to edit md5() to another crypt function, or remove it entirely, see line (51) in 'login.class.php'

<br />
<br />

<i>$home</i><br />
This is the location of your login page's template. Change this to wherever your template is located.
We have provided a default example, in an organized structure.
<br />
<br />

<i>$cookie_prefix</i><br />
Cookies are used to store (encrypted) login information to check if the user is logged in or not. 
You can give your cookies unique names with a prefix.
<br />
<br />

<i>$time</i><br />
This is the value (in minutes) of when set cookies will expire. If this was set to 120 for instance, after 120 minutes, or,
2 hours, the user's cookies would be destroyed. 
<br />
<br />
<hr />

<center><h2>Includes</h2></center>
There are three main files that should be included upon using some of these modules. 
<br />
[*]hx_config.php
<br />
[*]sys/modules/register/classes/register.class.php
<br />
[*]sys/modules/login/classes/login.class.php
<br />
<br />
There is one example file provided that can be used to make inclusions easier.
<br />
[ ]check.inc.php
<br />
<br />

<b>hx_config.php</b>
<br />
<i>Include on pages where the database will be used, or where definitions SITE, PATH, etc. will be used. 
This file is generally included on most pages.</i>
<br />
<br />

<b>register.class.php</b>
<br />
<i>Include on your registration page. By doing so, you will have access to the classes within that file.</i>
<br />
<br />

<b>login.class.php</b>
<br />
<i>Include on your login page. By doing so, you will have access to the classes within that file.</i>
<br />
<br />

<b>check.inc.php</b>
<br />
<i>'check.inc.php' automatically includes 'hx_config.php', and 'login.class.php'. 'check.inc.php' will then make
use of these files by using a method from the Login() class to check if the user is logged in or not. This 
is an example file that is included, and will save you potentially 4 lines of code each time you wish to
check to see if the user is logged in or not. Simply <b>require('check.inc.php');</b></i>
<br />
<br />
<hr />

<center><h2>Classes</h2></center>
There are two main classes we are focusing on with this release: Login() and Register(). You can use these classes
to create your own system to meet your own needs if you wish. You can do so with minimal lines of code.
<br />
<br />

<b>Login()</b>
<br />
To gain access to this class, you must first include the classfile 'login.class.php'. Once you have done so, you have
full access to the <i>Login()</i> class.
<br />
Start off by <b>creating your object</b>. Create a variable, and with the <b>new</b> keyword, assign the variable to the
<i>Login()</i> class.
<br />
<pre class="brush: php">
require('hx_config.php');
require(PATH . '/modules/login/classes/login.class.php');

$myvariable = new Login();
</pre>

Now we have our object '$myvariable'. We can now use the methods found within the <i>Login()</i> class by simply 
using <b>$myvariable->method()</b>. Lets go over some methods.
<br />
<br />

<b>$myvariable->doLogin($u,$p);</b>
<br />
This method will pass username,password off and will sanitize+hash accordingly, and will check them against the database.
If the username and password match an entry, doLogin() will set 2 cookies and will return true. Using this method is
as simple as this:
<br />
<pre class="brush: php">
$islogin = $myvariable->doLogin($_POST['username'],$_POST['password']);
//If $islogin is true...
</pre>
<br />

<b>$myvariable->chkLogin();</b>
<br />
This method requires no parameters and will do all the work for you upon calling it. It will check if the user is
logged in or not. If the user is not logged in, this method will redirect the user to AUTH (see earlier definitions). 
If the user is logged in, chkLogin() will do nothing. 
<br />
<br />

<b>$myvariable->setUser();</b>
<br />
This method requires no parameters and will do all the work for you upon calling it. This is an experimental method
and is not fully supported as of this release. This method will attempt to get the username of the user by checking
the cookies and comparing to database entries. If there is a result, it will return the result from a fetched array
["username"]. Using this method is as simple as:
<br />
<pre class="brush: php">
$user = $myvariable->setUser();
//echo $user;
</pre>
<br />
<br />

<b>Register()</b>
<br />
To gain access to this class, you must first include the classfile 'register.class.php'. Once you have done so, you have
full access to the <i>Register()</i> class.
<br />
Start off by <b>creating your object</b>. Create a variable, and with the <b>new</b> keyword, assign the variable to the
<i>Register()</i> class.
<br />
<pre class="brush: php">
require('hx_config.php');
require(PATH . '/modules/register/classes/register.class.php');

$myvariable = new Register();
</pre>

Now we have our object '$myvariable'. We can now use the methods found within the <i>Register()</i> class by simply 
using <b>$myvariable->method()</b>. Lets go over some methods.
<br />
<br />

<b>$myvariable->doRegister($e,$u,$p);</b>
<br />
This method will pass email,username,password off and will sanitize+hash accordingly, and will check them against the database.
If the email and username do not already exist, and all password criteria is made, the values will be added
to the database, and a verification key will be generated and sent to the user's email. Once the user validates this,
the user will be able to login. Using this method is as simple as this:
<br />
<pre class="brush: php">
$myvariable->doRegister($_POST['email'],$_POST['username'],$_POST['password']);
</pre>
<br />

<b>$myvariable->doValidate($u,$v);</b>
<br />
This method will pass username,validationkey off and will sanitize accordingly, and will check them against the database.
If the username and validation key match an existing entry in the database, this method will modify default table
`group` value from '0' to '1', which will allow the user to login and use your site accordingly.
Using this method is as simple as this:
<br />
<pre class="brush: php">
$myvariable->doValidate($_POST['username'],$_POST['verification_key']);
</pre>
<br />
<br />
